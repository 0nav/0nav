Iâ€™m a code-loving wizard from Punjab, currently brewing up knowledge at IKGPTU. My passions include web development, turning bugs into features, jamming to music, saving the planet (one recycled soda can at a time), and mastering the art of RRR (Reduce, Reuse, Rage when code doesnâ€™t run). 

Ready to debug life, one line at a time!
